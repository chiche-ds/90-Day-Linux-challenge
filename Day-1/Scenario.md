# Real-Life Scenario: System Health Check

**Objective**:  
- Apply Linux commands to check system health, verify disk usage, and review system information.

## Scenario:
You are a junior system administrator at a tech company. Your manager asks you to quickly check the system health of a new server before deployment.

## Task:
1. Use the `uname -r` command to verify the kernel version.
2. Use the `df -h` command to check disk space usage and identify any issues.
3. Use the `who` command to list active users.
4. Ensure the system is up-to-date by running the appropriate update command:
    - `apt-get update` (Ubuntu) or `yum update` (CentOS).

**Time estimate**: 30 minutes.
